        - - - -      <p class="content">From last year, CXtreme has embarked on a new project which 
        has attracted a lot of participants. It is the micromouse, a robot costing 
        S$2969. Currently the school has purchased 1 micromouse set. The micromouse 
        competition is open to all JCs, and involves programming at a higher level 
        as coding is done manually in C, where participants define their own functions 
        and routines. The micromouse we use is a souped-up version of the MKIT 
        900. As our code is getting too complex for the MIGS IDE to handle, we 
        have switched to the IDE2K C development environment. We will be having 
        courses on the C language and Micromouse API.<br>
