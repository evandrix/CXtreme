    <td colspan="4">The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, 
      coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed 
      for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. A unified 
      kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C. and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for 
      the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 
      341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. 
      It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th 
      century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, 
      the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest 
      of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Following the completion of the Suez 
      Canal in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub, but also 
      fell heavily into debt. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized 
      control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman 
      Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922, 
      Egypt acquired full sovereignty following World War II. The completion of 
      the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the 
      time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. 
      A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable 
      land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress 
      society. The government has struggled to ready the economy for the new millennium 
      through economic reform and massive investment in communications and physical 
      infrastructure.</td>
