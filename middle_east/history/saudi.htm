      <p>The Saudi state began in central Arabia in about 1750. A local ruler, 
        Muhammad bin Saud, joined forces with an Islamic reformer, Muhammad Abd 
        Al-Wahhab, to create a new political entity. Over the next one hundred 
        and fifty years, the fortunes of the Saud family rose and fell several 
        times as Saudi rulers contended with Egypt, the Ottoman Empire, and other 
        Arabian families for control on the peninsula. The modern Saudi state 
        was founded by the late King Abdul Aziz Al-Saud.</p>

        The discovery of oil in March 1938 transformed the country economically, 
        and has given the kingdom great legitimacy over the years. Today Saudi 
        Arabia enjoys a close relationship with the many western nations who purchase 
        Saudi oil.<br>
