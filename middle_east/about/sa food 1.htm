INGREDIENTS 
<p>* 1/2 cup fine bulghur<br>
  * 1 cupchicken broth (or water)<br>
  * 1 large ripe tomato, finely chopped<br>
  * 8 tablespoons finely chopped parsley leaves<br>
  * 4 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint leaves<br>
  * 1 medium onion scallions, or approx. equivalent of green onion<br>
  * 2 - 3 tablespoons olive oil<br>
  * 3-4 tablespoons lemon juice (or more if you prefer)<br>
  * 1 to 2 teaspoons salt<br>
  * Pepper</p>
<p>METHOD</p>
<p>Rinse bulghur and drain quickly. Place in a deep bowl and pour warm chicken 
  broth water over grains. Cover and allow to absorb liquid for about 20 to 25 
  minutes. Drain off any unabsorbed liquid and discard.</p>
<p>Add remaining ingredients - except oil and lemon juice - and toss to mix evenly. 
  Then add oil and lemon juice, tossing again to coat grains well. Adjust seasoning 
  according to taste, adding a little more lemon juice, salt or pepper.</p>
<p>Arrange lettuce leaves on a flat plate, and place a large mound of salad in 
  the middle. Serve with pita bread. Scoop up salad with lettuce leaves, fill 
  and roll up, or stuff into pita bread.</p>
<p>Serves: 4</p>
