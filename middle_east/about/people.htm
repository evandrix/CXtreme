              - Born in Riyadh in 1880,he followed his family into exile in Kuwait

              - After conquering and consolidating control over the Nejd and Hejaz 
              areas in the Arabian Peninsula in 1932, Ibn Saud proclaimed himself 
              King of Saudi Arabia<br>
              - Ibn Saud had 52 children by eight different women, 37 of which 
              were male and thus eligible to succeed him as Kings. In fact, Ibn 
              Saud is the father of all the Kings of Saudi Arabia that have succeeded 
              him</p></td>
          <td><p>Sami Al-Jaber (1972 to present)</p>
            <p>- A child prodigy, Al-Jaber began his professional career at the 
              tender age of 15 at Al-Hilal, Saudi Arabia's top club<br>
              - He earned his first international cap two years later, and was 
              an integral part of the team that qualified for the 1994 World Cup 
              in USA, scoring a hattrick against Iran to give Saudi Arabia its 
              first World Cup berth<br>
              - Al-Jaber also became the first Asian player to score a goal in 
              two consecutive World Cups when he scored against South Africa in 
              a 2-2 draw<br>
              - His impressive performances caught the attention of European scouts, 
              and Al-Jaber created another first by being the first Saudi professional 
              to play in English football when he spent five months on loan with 
              the English first division side Wolverhampton Wanderers<br>
              - He returned to Al-Hilal after five months in England without making

              - Unlike the powerful &quot;Sudairi Seven&quot; brothers who have 
              been close to one another all their lives, Crown Prince Abdullah 
              does not have any full brothers, but he cultivated close relationships 
              with half brothers and nephews who also lacked family allies because 
              they either had no full brothers or were isolated for some other 
              reason<br>
              - Crown Prince Abdullah has always had good relations with the various 
              leaders of the United States, meeting Gerald Ford in 1976, George 
              H.W. Bush in 1987 and Bill Clinton in 1998. His many visits to the 
              US have led to reports that Crown Prince Abdullah is considered 
              a great friend - to both the US and the Bush family<br>
              - Crown Prince Abdullah is also known as a philantrophist - after 
              hearing about the twins from a doctor, he paid for the surgery of 
              the Polish conjoined twins which took place at the King Abd al-Aziz 
              Medical City in Riyadh on 3rd January 2005. 14-month-old Daria and 
              Olga Kolacz were successfully separated after the surgery which 
              took 15 hours.</p></td>
