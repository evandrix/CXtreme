* 1 cup hibiscus petals<br>
* 2 cups sugar
<p>Pick over the dried petals, removing any stems or leaves. Soak the hibiscus 
  petals in cold water to cover for 1-2 hours. Transfer the petals and water to 
  a pot and bring to a boil. Remove the pot immediately and strain the liquid 
  through filter paper. Return the petals to the pot, add fresh cold water to 
  cover, and repeat as above. Repeat the process until the karkady loses its reddish 
  hue. Then, discard the petals and sweeten the juice while it is still hot. Serve 
  cold, although it is a pleasant drink when served warm in the wintertime.<br>
