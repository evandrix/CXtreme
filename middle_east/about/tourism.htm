        More about Abu Dhabi Emirate <br>
        Abu Dhabi is the largest of the seven Emirates and the Federal capital 
        of the UAE. It occupies an area of 26,000 square miles. Its long coastline 
        - the shallow waters of the Southern Gulf, extending from the base of 
        the Qatar Peninsula in the west to the border of the emirate of Dubai 
        on the north east, was once the world's best waters for pearling. When 
        the pearling industry declined, oil discovery in the offshore oilfields 
        of the Southern Gulf revived the economy of Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi was also 
        the first emirate to export oil from the Umm Shaif offshore field in 1962. 
        On the land, it stretches south to the oases of Liwa where some of the 
        world¡¯s largest sand dunes can be found , and east to the ancient oasis 
        of Al Ain. This makes Abu Dhabi the largest as well as the most populated 
        of all the emirates. <br>
        Today over 120 million trees have been planted in the emirate of Abu Dhabi 
        alone. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Sharjah is situated between Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah interrupted by the 
        small enclave of Ajman.<br>
        Its coastline runs to approximately thirty kilometres along the Arabian 
        Gulf. Sophisticated highways connect it to the other emirates. <br>
        Sharjah was once part of a single emirate along with Ras Al Khaimah ruled 
        by the Al Qawasim family. H.H. Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qassimi took 
        over as Ruler in 1972 - a scholar in History, he has been conferred with 
        a PhD (Doctorate in Philosophy) for his outstanding work. <br>
        Under his able guidance, Sharjah has made rapid progress. Today, it is 
        known as the Cultural capital of the U.A.E. Sharjah is the headquarters 
        for the UAE Authors' and Writers' Union which has over a hundred publications 
        to its credit. <br>
        In 1971, the discovery of the Mubarak oilfield near the island of Abu 
        Musa changed the fortunes of the emirate. In 1981, after Mubarak's reserves 
        started dwindling, Saja's onshore gas and liquid gas field was discovered 
        which gave a further boost to its revenues. <br>
        Sharjah was also the first port in the entire middle east to possess fully 
        equipped container facilities at the Sharjah Container Terminal. Its impressive 
        port at Khorfakkan provides important facilities for ships that do not 
        need to enter the Gulf. <br>
        Sharjah is also the capital of Cricket in the U.A.E. It is now famous 
        in the sub-continent and throughout the cricketing world as a major venue 
        for One Day Internationals. <br>
        Sharjah was one of the first emirates to promote tourism. The peaceful 
        hamlets of Khorfakkan and Kalba are a major tourist attraction and provide 
        a getaway from the hustle bustle of the city life.</p>
