Ingredients (serves 4)
<p>* 2.5 cups of short rice<br>
  * 1 liter milk<br>
  * 0.5 cup of sugar<br>
  * 1 table spoon of starch dissolved in ? cup of water<br>
  * 1 teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>Wash the rice thoroughly, then let it settle in water for about 15 minutes. 
  Sieve the rice and place in a pot. Top the rice with water and place on a medium 
  flame. Let the rice boil for five minutes. Do not let the water dry up. The 
  rice is supposed to be soggy! Sieve the partially boiled rice again.</p>
<p>In a separate container add mix the sugar to the milk and stir until the sugar 
  is completely dissolved.</p>
<p>Add the sweetened milk to the rice and stir slowly for a minute. Place the 
  mixture of rice milk and sugar on low flame and let it boil for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Dissolve the starch in some water and add to boiling rice. Stir slowly until 
  the mixture thickens.</p>
<p>Remove from heat. Let it cool for five minutes before you add the vanilla.</p>
<p>Pour into smaller bowls and chill in the fridge.</p>
<p>The above recipe is the original recipe for Ros Bel Laban. However, the toppings 
  may vary. You can be creative. Try unsalted nuts, for example, pistachio and/or 
  hazelnut. Shredded dried coconut will add a special taste to the desert. You 
  can even carry the topping to a further extent and add ice cream as on top of 
  the bowl of Ros. Trust me it will taste nice. Ros Bel Laban is a very high calorie 
  sweet dish and is perfect for breakfast especially if the kids are going to 
  spend a day playing sports.<br>
