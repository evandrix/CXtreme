    <td colspan="4"><h5>Saudi Arabia</h5><p><br>
        Saudi Arabian culture revolves almost entirely around Islam. Two of Islam's 
        holiest sites are in the country, and it considers itself the birthplace 
        of the religion. Every day, five times a day, Muslims are called to prayer 
        from the minarets of mosques which dot the country. Friday is its sabbath 
        day. Islam derives from the same monotheistic roots as Judaism and Christianity, 
        and Muslims generally regard Christians with respect - in Islam, Jesus 
        is regarded as one of the Prophets of Allah, and Jews and Christians are 
        considered fellow 'people of the Book'. Islam's holy book The Qur'an is 
        Saudi Arabia's constitution, and Shari'ah (Islamic law) is the foundation 
        of its legal system.<br>
        Saudi Arabian dress is strongly symbolic, representing the people's ties 
        to the land, the past and to Islam. The predominantly loose, flowing but 
        covering garments reflect the practicalities of life in a desert country 
        as well as Islam's emphasis on conservative dress. Traditionally, men 
        usually wear an ankle-length shirt woven from wool or cotton (known as 
        a thawb), with a ghutra (a large square of cotton held in place by a cord 
        coil) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a camel-hair 
        cloak (bisht) over the top. Women's clothes are decorated with tribal 
        motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread and appliques. However, Saudi 
        women must wear a long black coat (abaya) and veil (niqab) when they leave 
        the house to protect their modesty.<br>
        Islamic law forbids the eating of pork and the drinking of alcohol, and 
        this law is followed strictly throughout Saudi Arabia. Arabic unleavened 
        bread, or khobz, is eaten with almost all meals. Other staples include 
        grilled chicken, felafel (deep-fried chickpea balls), shwarma (spit-cooked 
        sliced lamb), and fuul (a paste of fava beans, garlic and lemon). Traditional 
        coffee houses used to be ubiquitous, but are now being displaced by food-hall 
        style cafes.<br>

      <h5>Egypt</h5>
      <p>The capital city, Cairo, is Africa's largest city and has been renowned 
        for centuries as a center of learning, culture and commerce of Egypt. 
        Though considered a low-income country, Egypt has a thriving media and 
        arts industry, with more than 30 satellite channels and more than 100 
        motion pictures produced a year. To bolster its media industry, especially 
        with the keen competition from the Persian Gulf states and Lebanon, it 
        has built a large media city that it has promoted as the &quot;Hollywood 
        of the East&quot;. Egypt has the only opera house amongst Arab countries. 
      </p>
      <h5>UAE</h5><p><br>
      The United Arab Emirates is an ideal environment for artists. With a 
        rich cultural heritage reaching back for millennia, today¡¯s artists are 
        part of an ongoing tradition that has gained inspiration from a harsh, 
        but stunningly beautiful environment. Creativity is nurtured from a young 
        age and many works of art reflect the innate spirituality of the Emiratis. 
        The paintings in this gallery are a representation of today¡¯s generation 
        of artists, whose vision is moulded not only by a desert past, but by 
        the exciting challenge of a future at the cutting edge of twenty-first 
        century innovation. </p>
      <p>The tribe has been the principal building block of UAE society since 
        successive waves of migrations, beginning in the middle of the first millennium 
        BC, brought Arab tribes to the region. The varied terrain which these 
        tribes inhabited, i.e desert, oasis, mountains and coast, dictated the 
        traditional lifestyles that evolved over the centuries but the common 
        thread was the resourcefulness which the people displayed in exploiting 
        to the limit their harsh environment. This was assisted by the age-old 
        social structure in which each family was traditionally bound by obligations 
        of mutual assistance to his immediate relatives and to the tribe as a 
        whole. Among the tribe an individual¡¯s selfless hospitality was the source 
        of his honour and pride. A common religion, Islam, also provided the cement 
        which held the people together.</p>
      <p>The largest tribe the Bani Yas, roamed the vast sandy areas which cover 
        almost all of the emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Other tribes, too, 
        such as the Awamir and Manasir, shared this challenging environment for 
        numerous generations. All the subtribes and clans were accustomed to wander 
        great distances with their camels in search of grazing, moving as entire 
        family units. Almost all Bani Yas families, with the exception of fishing 
        groups like the Al Rumaithat, returned to a home in one of the oasis settlements 
        at certain times of the year. Much-prized date gardens were cultivated 
        in the hollows of the huge dunes at Liwa, tapping the water trapped beneath 
        the absorbent sands. In Al Ain and other oasis the luxuriant date gardens 
        were watered by an efficient traditional irrigation system (falaj. Ar.pl 
        aflaj) bringing water from aquifers in the mountains. In the narrow mountain 
        wadis (valleys), falaj-like watercourses (ghayl) were used to irrigate 
        terraced gardens tended by extended families.</p>
      <p>Most of the tribes spent some of their time engaged in fishing and pearling 
        ,which were just another means of exploiting all available resources. 
        As pearling flourished, an increasing number of the able-bodied men participated 
        in the dive (ghaus) during four months in the summer. Eventually, the 
        pearling boom brought increased urbanization with a great mix of tribal 
        people settling in coastal towns and villages. This process was hugely 
        accelerated by the discovery and export of oil. So much so that life in 
        the UAE today bears little resemblance to that of 30 or 40 years ago. 
        Nevertheless, there is a deep awareness at all levels that the preservation 
        of such a hard-won heritage provides a necessary bridge to the past and 
        a solid basis to meet the challenges of the future.</p>
