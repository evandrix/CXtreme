5 tbsp. cornstarch<br>
2 cups mixed fruit <br>
2 cups cream<br>
2 tbsp. rose water <br>
3 cups milk<br>
5 tbsp. Sugar <br>

  stirring constantly until thick. Pour contents of the pan into a deep dish. 
  Add half the amount of mixed fruit. Set aside to cool and thicken. Spread half 
  the cream on top of the cooled fruit mixture and put the dish in the refrigerator.
