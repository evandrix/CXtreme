      <p>This is following the article about SM Goh's visit to Saudi Arabia:</p>
      <p><em>SM Goh says his visit to Saudi Arabia has strengthened ties</em></p>
      <p>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong says his 4-day visit to Saudi Arabia has 
        helped to forge closer economic and political ties with the country. Singapore 
        hopes to manage the funds of wealthy individuals and institutions from 
        Saudi Arabia if they decide to park their funds outside Europe and the 
        United States. During his visit, the Senior Minister met key Saudi leaders 
        and also enjoyed a taste of Saudi culture and hospitality. Mr Goh says 
        he has achieved his main aim of signalling Singapore's interest to nurture 
        stronger ties with Saudi Arabia. He said: &quot;I must say that I've achieved 
        my purpose, the Saudis are very warm. They took my visit seriously. In 
        a way, they treated me like a PM from the arrangement of meetings to the 
        hospitality provided to me. In a way, they're signalling to me they want 
        to have better ties with Singapore. So this is a beginning of a stronger 
        relationship between Saudi Arabia and Singapore.&quot; He added that the 
        Middle East is undergoing change and is an important region that Singapore 
        investors should explore. </p>
      <p><br>
        Mr Goh plans to bring a business delegation in April or May to Saudi Arabia 
        and invite a Saudi business delegation to Singapore to match opportunities. 
        He feels fund management is a key area: &quot;We believe that they park 
        their funds mostly in London and Zurich and even to some extent New York 
        before September 11. And naturally they want good returns from their funds. 
        And post-Sept 11, they maybe looking towards Asia and see where they can 
        increase the returns to their funds. So, I'm trying to catch their eye 
        if they're looking at Asia because Singapore can manage their assets or 
        funds of the wealthy individuals in Saudi Arabia.&quot; </p>
      <p><br>
        To enhance Singapore's attractiveness as a financial centre, Singapore 
        is looking into offering Islamic banking services and products. This will 
        enable the Republic to take advantage of the diversion of funds from conventional 
        banking into Islamic banking in the region. Mr Goh who's also the Chairman 
        of Singapore's Monetary Authority, said the MAS is studying Islamic banking 
        and will organise a seminar to build its knowledge. &quot;We don't set 
        out to compete against Malaysia. We set out to work with Malaysia on what 
        products that they have, what we can buy from them and what we can sell 
        to the investors. The funds available are huge. So, if we can attract 
        some of that funds to Singapore, we can enhance our own financial centre 
        status,&quot; he added. </p>
      <p><br>
        Mr Goh also said that his visit to Saudi Arabia has dispelled some of 
        his own misconceptions about its peoples. Although the people of Saudi 
        Arabia are culturally conservative, many of them do recognise the need 
        to embrace change and this promises fresh opportunities for others. -
